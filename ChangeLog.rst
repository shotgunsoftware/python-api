    This adds a highly experimental 'Mockgun' Shotgun API mocker to the
    Shotgun API. This is being moved across from the Toolkit unit test rig
    into the Shotgun API to allow for a wider range of use and reuse.
    
    Mockgun is highly experimental at this point. It only supports a subset
    of the Shotgun API and we are likely to make big and potentally breaking
    changes to this in the future.

      and attachments, via a single call.

    errors and adds doc strings to some of the public methods that

        - "#30199 Update httplib2 to latest version v0.9.1
    This fixes an issue where a CertificateHostnameMismatch exception would be thrown incorrectly when creating a secure connection via the API. The bug was not properly iterating through the entire list of valid hostnames to match the request against. Instead, it was only checking the first host in the list.
    
    Updated the API to specifically set proxy_info=None when no proxy information is set in the config. Previously httplib2 defaulted to using None if this parameter wasn't provided but this changed and it now assigns a ProxyInfo instance by default. Setting this to None ensures no proxy is attempted for the connection.
    
    Other various bug fixes specific to the library are also included. See https://github.com/jcgregorio/httplib2/blob/master/CHANGELOG for the full list." by kp (ac36810f8d6f31ab5b4ea68b755b5794dab053df):

        - "For #28019, support for session based execution and some minor tweaks.
    
    A collection of security related changes, mostly from #77. Here's a
    summary of the changes:
    
    - Ability to create a sg api from a session token. This allows a user
      to instantiate a shotgun API given a session token produced by the
      sg.get_session_token() method.
    - Added a sg.get_session_token() method to generate session tokens.
    - Added a new AuthenticationFault exception type (deriving from Fault
      and backwards compatible) to indicate when a connection fails due to
      authentication.
    - In the interest of API symmetry, added sg.config.raw_http_proxy
      which contains the same raw proxy string that is passed into
      the API constructor. This is handy if you need to create an sg API
      instance based on an existing instance, and want to make sure that
      the same proxy settings are used.
    - To make it easy to set up your own httplib2 based connection
      to Shotgun (sometimes useful), added an sg.config.proxy_handler
      which represents the proxy handler that is used by Shotgun when it
      connects via httplib2.
    
    Closes #81." by manne (e5387f38cf14ec3c0253b8422d0db33fc235ba69):
