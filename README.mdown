# Shotgun Python API

Shotgun provides a simple Python-based API for accessing Shotgun and integrating with other tools. This is the official API that is maintained by Shotgun Software (support@shotgunsoftware.com)

## New home

[GitHub is the new official location](http://github.com/shotgunsoftware/python-api) for the latest Shotgun Python API. We will no longer be including it in our code tree that is deployed to your servers or posting it for download from our support site. So update your bookmarks!

## Minimum Requirements
- Shotgun server v1.8.0 or higher. Note that some API features are only available in later Shotgun server versions.
- Python v2.4 - v2.7. (We do have plans to eventually support Python 3)

## Installing
To use Shotgun's Python API module, you need to place it in one of the directories specified by the environment variable PYTHONPATH. For more information on PYTHONPATH and using modules in Python, see http://docs.python.org/tutorial/modules.html

## Documentation
Tutorials and detailed documentation about the Python API are available on the [Shotgun Support website](https://support.shotgunsoftware.com/forums/48807-developer-api-info).
