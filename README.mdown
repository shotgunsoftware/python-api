# Shotgun Python API

Shotgun provides a simple Python-based API for accessing Shotgun and integrating with other tools. This is the official API that is maintained by Shotgun Software (support@shotgunsoftware.com)

The latest version can always be found at http://github.com/shotgunsoftware/python-api

## Minimum Requirements

* Shotgun server v2.4.12 or higher. (Earlier builds of 2.4 will work, but have buggy support for float field types)
* Python v2.4 - v2.7.

## High Performance Requirements

* For Python 2.4 and 2.5, install simplejson 2.0.9: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/simplejson/2.0.9
* For Python 2.6 and higher, install simplejson 2.1.6: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/simplejson/2.1.6

## Installing
To use Shotgun's Python API module, you need to place the package shotgun_api3 in one of the directories specified by the environment variable PYTHONPATH. For more information on PYTHONPATH and using modules in Python, see http://docs.python.org/tutorial/modules.html

### Installing with `pip`
 
#### Master 
If you wish to install the current master, use the following command (Note that master contains the latest revisions and is largely considered "stable" but it is not an official packaged release. If you want the latest packaged release, use the latest tag number):  
`pip install git+git://github.com/shotgunsoftware/python-api.git`

#### Specific Versions 
To install a specific version of the package with `pip` (recommended), run the following command 
(This example installs the v3.0.9 tag. Replace the version tag with the one you want):  
`pip install git+git://github.com/shotgunsoftware/python-api.git@v3.0.9`

#### requirements.txt
If you're using pip with `requirements.txt`, add the following line:  
`git+git://github.com/shotgunsoftware/python-api.git`

## Documentation
Tutorials and detailed documentation about the Python API are available on the [Python API Wiki](https://github.com/shotgunsoftware/python-api/wiki). There is also some additional related documentation on the [Shotgun Support Website](https://support.shotgunsoftware.com/forums/48807-developer-api-info).
Some useful direct links in each are below:

* [Reference: Data Types](https://github.com/shotgunsoftware/python-api/wiki/Reference%3A-Data-Types)
* [Reference: Filter Syntax](https://github.com/shotgunsoftware/python-api/wiki/Reference%3A-Filter-Syntax)

## Tests 

Integration and unit tests are provided. 

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/shotgunsoftware/python-api.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/shotgunsoftware/python-api)

- test_client and tests_unit mock server interaction and do not require a shotgun instance to be available.
- test_api and test_api_long do require a shotgun instance, with a script key available for the tests. These tests rely on a tests/config file, which can be created by renaming example_config and supplying the server and script user values. The tests will set up test data on the server based on the data set forth in the config. This data will be manipulated by the tests, and should not be used for other purposes.
- To run all of the tests, use the shell script run-tests. This script require nose to be installed.

  + added: #18171 New ca_certs argument to the Shotgun() constructor to specify the certificates to use in SSL validation
  + added: setup.py doesn't compress the installed .egg file which makes the cacerts.txt file accessible

**v3.0.11 - 2013 Jan 31**

  + added: nested filter syntax, see https://github.com/shotgunsoftware/python-api/wiki/Reference%3A-Filter-Syntax

**v3.0.10 - 2013 Jan 25**

  + added: add_user_agent() and reset_user_agent methods to allow client code to add strings to track.
