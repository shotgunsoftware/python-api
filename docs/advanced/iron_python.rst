IronPython
**********

We do not test against IronPython and cannot be sure that we won't introduce breaking changes or
that we will be compatible with future releases of IronPython. While we don't officially support
IronPython, we certainly will do our best to figure out any issues that come up while using it and
how to avoid them.

As of July 9, 2015 you can look at this fork of the repo to see what changes were needed as of that
date to make things work. The original fork was as of v3.0.20 of the API. Big thanks to our awesome
clients Pixomondo for making their work public and letting us refer to it:

https://github.com/Pixomondo/python-api/tree/v3.0.20.ipy

v3.0.20 can be used with IronPython with a little bit of added work:

- The Python API uses the zlib module to handle decompressing the gzipped response from the server.
  There's no built-in zlib module in IronPython, but there's a potential solution from Jeff Hardy at
  https://bitbucket.org/jdhardy/ironpythonzlib/src/. And the blog post about it here
  http://blog.jdhardy.ca/2008/12/solving-zlib-problem-ironpythonzlib.html

- If you encounter any SSL errors like
  ``unknown field: SERIALNUMBER=0123456789`` or ``:SSL3_GET_SERVER_CERTIFICATE:certificate verify failed``.
  For now you can workaround this problem by disabling ssl certificate validation which we've
  encountered some intermittent issues with. Set ``NO_SSL_VALIDATION = True`` for either case.
  See :const:`shotgun_api3.shotgun.NO_SSL_VALIDATION`

- If you encounter ``LookupError: unknown encoding: idna``, you can force utf-8 by changing
  iri2uri.py ~ln 71 from ``authority = authority.encode('idna')`` to
  ``authority = authority.encode('utf-8')``

- If you encounter an SSL error such as ``SSL3_READ_BYTES:sslv3 alert handshake failure``, then the
  lower level SSL library backing python's network infrastructure is attempting to connect to our
  servers via SSLv3, which is no longer supported. You can use the code from this gist to force the
  SSL connections to use a specific protocol. The forked repo linked above has an example of how to
  do that to force the use of TLSv1.
