.. automethod:: Shotgun.authenticate_human_user
.. automethod:: Shotgun.get_session_token
.. automethod:: Shotgun.set_up_auth_cookie
.. automethod:: Shotgun.add_user_agent
.. automethod:: Shotgun.reset_user_agent
.. automethod:: Shotgun.set_session_uuid
.. automethod:: Shotgun.info

*************
Filter Syntax
*************

Basic Filters
=============

Filters are represented as a list of conditions that will be combined using the supplied
filter_operator (``any`` or ``all``). Each condition follows the basic simple form::

    [<field>, <relation>, <value(s)>]

Basic Example
-------------
Using the default filter_operator ``"all"``, the following filters will return all Shots whose status
is "ip" AND is linked to Asset #9::

    filters = [
        ["sg_status_list", "is", "ip"],
        ["assets", "is", {"type": "Asset", "id": 9}]
    ]
    result = sg.find("Shot", filters)


Complex Filters
===============

.. versionadded::3.0.11

Complex filters can be a dictionary that represents a complex sub-condition of the form::

    {"filter_operator": "any", "filters": [<list of conditions>]}

Complex Example
---------------
Using the default filter_operator ``"all"``, the following filters will return all Shots whose status
is "ip" AND is linked to either Asset #9 OR Asset #23::

    filters = [
        ["sg_status_list", "is", "ip"],
        {
            "filter_operator": "any",
            "filters": [
                ["assets", "is", {"type": "Asset", "id": 9}],
                ["assets", "is", {"type": "Asset", "id": 23}]
            ]
        }
    ]
    result = sg.find("Shot", filters)

Additional Filter Presets
=========================

As of Shotgun version 7.0 it is possible to also use filter presets. These presets provide a simple 
way to specify powerful query filters that would otherwise be costly and difficult to craft using 
traditional filters.

Multiple presets can be specified in cases where it makes sense.

Also, these presets can be used alongside normal filters. The result returned is an AND operation 
between the specified filters.

Example Uses
------------

The following query will return the Version with the name 'ABC' that is linked to the latest entity 
created::

    additional_filter_presets = [
        {
            "preset_name": "LATEST",
            "latest_by":   "ENTITIES_CREATED_AT"
        }
    ]

    filters = [['code', 'is', 'ABC']]

    result = sg.find('Version', filters = filters, additional_filter_presets = additional_filter_presets)


The following query will find all CutItems associated to Cut #1 and return all Versions associated 
to the Shot linked to each of these CutItems::

    additional_filter_presets = [
        {
            "preset_name": "CUT_SHOT_VERSIONS",
            "cut_id":       1
        }
    ]

    result = sg.find('Version', additional_filter_presets = additional_filter_presets)

Available Filter Presets by Entity Type
---------------------------------------

Allowed filter presets (and preset parameter values) depend on the entity type being searched.

The table bellow gives the details about which filter preset can be used on each entity type and 
with which parameters.

::

    Entity Type Preset Name       Preset Parameters   Allowed Preset Parameter Values
    ----------- -----------       -----------------   -------------------------------
    Cut         LATEST            [string] latest_by  'REVISION_NUMBER':
                                                        Returns the cuts that have the
                                                        highest revision number.
                                                        This is typically used with a query
                                                        filter that returns cuts with the
                                                        same value for a given field
                                                        (e.g. code field). This preset
                                                        therefore allows to get
                                                        the Cut of that set that has
                                                        the highest revision_number value.

                                                        Returns all Version entities
                                                        associated to the Shot entity
                                                        associated to the CutItems
                                                        of the given Cut.
                                                        This basically allows to find all
                                                        Versions associated to the given
                                                        Cut, via its CutItems.

                LATEST            [string] latest_by  'ENTITIES_CREATED_AT':
                                                        When dealing with multiple
                                                        Versions associated to a group
                                                        of entities, returns only the
                                                        last Version created for each
                                                        entity.
                                                        For example, when dealing with a
                                                        set of Shots, this preset allows
                                                        to find the latest Version created
                                                        for each of these Shots.

                                                        When dealing with multiple versions
                                                        associated to the same entity *and*
                                                        to Tasks, returns the Version
                                                        associated to the Task with highest
                                                        step.list_order.
                                                        If multiple Versions are found for
                                                        that step.list_order, only the
                                                        latest Version is returned.
                                                        This allows to isolate the Version
                                                        entity that is the farthest along
                                                        in the pipeline for a given entity.
                                                        For example, when dealing with a Shot
                                                        with multiple Versions, this preset
                                                        will return the Version associated
                                                        to the Task with the highest
                                                        step.list_order value.

.. _event_types:

***********
Event Types
***********

Whenever a user makes a change to any data in Shotgun, an event log entry record is created, 
capturing the value before and after. Shotgun also logs some additional useful events that help keep 
track of various activity on your Shotgun instance.

Event-based Triggers
====================

Events are particularlly useful when used in conjunction with a trigger framework like the
`Shotgun Event Daemon <https://github.com/shotgunsoftware/shotgunEvents>`_. This allows you to 
write plug-ins that watch for certain types of events and then run code when they occur.
   
Structure of Event Types
========================

The basic structure of event types is broken into 3 parts:

``Application_EntityType_Action``

- ``Application``: Is always "Shotgun" for events automatically created by the Shotgun server. 
  Other Shotgun products may use their name in here, for example, Toolkit has its own events
  that it logs and the application portion is identified by "Toolkit". If you decide to use the 
  EventLogEntry entity to log events for your scripts or tools, you would use your tool name here.
- ``EntityType``: This is the entity type in Shotgun that was acted upon (eg. Shot, Asset, etc.)
- ``Action``: The general action that was taken. (eg. New, Change, Retirement, Revival)   
   

Standard Event Types
====================

Each entity type has a standard set of events associated with it when it's created, updated, 
deleted, and revived. They follow this pattern:

- ``Shotgun_EntityType_New``: a new entity was created. Example: ``Shotgun_Task_New``
- ``Shotgun_EntityType_Change``: an entity was modified. Example: ``Shotgun_HumanUser_Change``
- ``Shotgun_EntityType_Retirement``: an entity was deleted. Example: ``Shotgun_Ticket_Retirement``
- ``Shotgun_EntityType_Revival``: an entity was revived. Example: ``Shotgun_CustomEntity03_Revival``   

Additional Event Types
======================

These are _some_ of the additional event types that are logged by Shotgun:
 
- ``Shotgun_Attachment_View``: an Attachment (file) was viewed by a user.
- ``Shotgun_Reading_Change``: a threaded entity has been marked read or unread. For example, a 
  Note was read by a user. The readings are unique to the entity<->user connection so when a 
  Note is read by user "joe" it may still be unread by user "jane".
- ``Shotgun_User_Login``: a user logged in to Shotgun.
- ``Shotgun_User_Logout``: a user logged out of Shotgun. 
   

Custom Event Types
==================

Since ``EventLogEntries`` are entities themselves, you can create them using the API just like any 
other entity type. As mentioned previously, if you'd like to have your scripts or tools log to 
the Shotgun event log, simply devise a thoughtful naming structure for your event types and 
create the EventLogEntry as needed following the usual methods for creating entities via the API.

Again, other Shotgun products like Toolkit use event logs this way.

.. note:: 
    EventLogEntries cannot be updated or deleted (that would defeat the purpose of course).   
   
Performance
===========

Event log database tables can get large very quickly. While Shotgun does very well with event logs 
that get into the millions of records, there's an inevitable degradation of performance for pages 
that display them in the web application as well as any API queries for events when they get too 
big. This volume of events is not the norm, but can be reached if your server expereinces high 
usage. 

This **does not** mean your Shotgun server performance will suffer in general, just any pages that 
are specifically displaying EventLogEntries in the web application, or API queries on the event
log that are run. We are always looking for ways to improve this in the future. If you have any
immediate concerns, please `reach out to our support team <https://support.shotgunsoftware.com>`_
