.. warning::
    Smart Cut Fields should be considered deprecated. Shotgun v7.0, introduced a new version of 
    cut support. `Read the Cut Support Documentation here <https://support.shotgunsoftware.com/hc/en-us/articles/222840748>`_.

If you want to work with 'smart' cut fields through the API, your script should use a corresponding
'raw' fields for all updates. The 'smart_cut_fields' are primarily for display in the UI, the real 
data is stored in a set of 'raw' fields that have different names.

************
Smart Fields
************

In the UI these fields attempt to calculate values based on data entered into the various fields. 
These fields can be queried via the API using the find() method, but not updated. Note that we are 
deprecating this feature and recommend creating your own cut fields from scratch, which will not 
contain any calculations which have proven to be too magical at times.

- ``smart_cut_duration``
- ``smart_cut_in``
