Shotgun Python API Changelog
****************************

Here you can see the full list of changes between each Python API release.

v3.0.33.dev (TBD)
=================

- Raise an exception when uploading an empty file using :meth:`upload`, :meth:`upload_thumbnail` 
  or :meth:`upload_filmstrip_thumbnail` before calling out to the server.
- Multiple enhancements and bugfixes to Mockgun:
   - Added support for filters using the `filter_operator` syntax.
   - `is` and `is_not` comparisons with an entity or multi-entity field set to `None` are now handled.

   - Added support for dotted notation in find parameters (e.g. `users.HumanUser.login`) on both entity and multi-entity fields.
   - Added unit tests for Mockgun in `test_mockgun.py`. The tests currently cover all the fixes and features mentionned above.
   - Schemas are written using pickle's highest protocol as of Python 2.4's release, which speeds up the loading from disk.
