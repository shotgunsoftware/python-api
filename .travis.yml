# We need to test on multiple distros, since python 2.6 is not supported in xenial
# and 3.7 is not supported in trusty.  For now just use trusty to test 2.6, and use
# the more modern xenial for 2.7 and 3.7.

# Additionally, we'll test on multiple sites.  To accomplish this, we store the
# secrets for the second site in a set of additional environment variables,
# and copy those into the standard environment variables when running on the
# second site.
